                            I'm about 60% complete with the website as of writing. Two days ago, I was 80% complete. Scope creep comes for me eventually, I suppose.
                            It's how a lot of my projects go, anyway. I'm only ever content leaving something unfinished (in my vision at least) 
                            if I tell myself I'll get the rest done <span class="text-styled" style="font-style: italic;">later</span>. To be fair, I sometimes do.

                            <br><br>I wouldn't have it any other way, anyhow. It reminds me of something that my dad said (paraphrased): <i>some people enjoy the process,
                            and some enjoy the end result</i>. I think of myself as a practical person, but I find for some things that I've become more
                            focused on the process itself as I've gotten older. 

                            <br><br>To be honest, programming has been keeping me grounded for the past couple years, for both the process and the result. Without it, 
                            I would certainly be desk-rotting whenever I'm home.
                            I'm also not really in any creative field besides anything involving programming either, at least for the moment. So, as both a 
                            hobby and a creative outlet it's been invaluable.

                            <br><br>It's taken me so much longer to get this done than I thought it would. As it's my first time making a real website (though not first time doing a GUI),
                            there's been some pains. For a decent while I had the width of all of the content boxes be 90% of the page (this looked bad). At least I don't have
                            to deal with HTML or js for the first time again. 
                            
                            <br><br>Although I'm <i>not</i> happy with the time it's taking, I am definitely happy with how good the site is starting to look, at least to me. 
                            The star / constellation background turned out really well, and I've got most of all of the main stuff I need on here already.

                            <br><br>In other news, I just found out that <span style="text-shadow: 2px 2px 0px red, 0px -2px 0px green, -2px 2px 0px blue;">chromatic aberration</span> 
                            (or at least some effect like it) is very easy to do with HTML styling. Don't know what I'll end up doing with that, but I think it looks cool.
